package:
  name: bouncycastle-fips-1.0
  # *** DO NOT INCREMENT THIS VERSION ***
  # It has to be pinned to v1.0.2.4, as this is the current (latest) FIPS validated version.
  # This can ONLY be incremented when BouncyCastle have re-certified the later version, and
  # issued an updated FIPS certificate. See:
  #   - https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/Certificate/4616
  #   - https://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bouncy-castle-java-fips/#latest
  # Advisories will have to be filed for any CVEs as a result.
