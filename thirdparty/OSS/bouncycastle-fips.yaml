    # *** DO NOT INCREMENT THIS VERSION ***
    # It has to be pinned to v2.0.0, as this is the current (latest) FIPS validated version.
    # This can ONLY be incremented when BouncyCastle have re-certified the later version, and
    # issued an updated FIPS certificate. See:
    #   - https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/Certificate/4616
    #   - https://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bouncy-castle-java-fips/#latest
    # Advisories will have to be filed for any CVEs as a result.
    #
    # We don't build these packages from source due to signing and licensing issues.
    # Therefore, we cannot automatically upgrade them based on GitHub tags/releases
    # and/or release-monitoring.org
    #
    # Before upgrading this package to a newer version, you must verify whether the version was
    # certified. See the above check.
